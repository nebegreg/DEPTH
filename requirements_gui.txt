# Notes:
# ------
# 1. For CUDA support, install PyTorch with CUDA:
#    pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#
# 2. xformers may require specific CUDA version. If installation fails:
#    pip install xformers --no-deps
#    Or skip it (performance will be slightly reduced)
#
# 3. For older GPUs without xformers support, see:
#    https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3/issues/11
#
# 4. Recommended: Create a virtual environment first:
#    python -m venv venv
#    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
#    pip install -r requirements_gui.txt
#
# 5. For the core Depth Anything v3 package:
#    cd Depth-Anything-3-main
#    pip install -e .
